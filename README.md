# Build Agents with ADK: Foundations+
### Workshop Project — "CeritaNenek" 👵🏻🪄
*Learn the difference between regular and power-prompted agents using Google’s Agentic Development Kit (ADK).*


---


## 🧩 Overview
This workshop extends the official [Build Agents with ADK: Foundations](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/devsite/codelabs/build-agents-with-adk-foundation?hl=en) codelab with a fun, local twist — **CeritaNenek**, an Indonesian storytelling agent.
hence - the plus


You’ll build **two versions of the same agent**:
1. A **basic version** using simple instructions (regular prompt)
2. An **enhanced version** using **power prompting** for richer, more human-like storytelling


This side-by-side comparison helps beginners *see and feel* the power of structured prompting in action.
