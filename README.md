# Build Agents with ADK: Foundations+ 👵🏻✨
### Workshop Project — "CeritaNenek"

*Learn the difference between regular agents and **Power-Prompted** agents using Google’s Agentic Development Kit (ADK) and the new **Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview**.*


---


## 0. Overview

In this extended version of the [ADK Foundations Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/devsite/codelabs/build-agents-with-adk-foundation) by Thu Ya Kyaw, you will embark on a journey to build **CeritaNenek** — a virtual Indonesian grandmother who doesn't just chat, but comforts you with warmth and folklore.

We will build two versions of the same agent to demonstrate how **Power Prompting** transforms an AI's personality.

### 📚 What You’ll Learn
* The fundamentals of the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.
* How to use the *NEW* **Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview** model for superior reasoning.
* The difference between a **Basic Instruction** and a **Power Prompt**.
* How to engineer empathy, cultural context, and structure into an agent.

### 🛠️ What You’ll Build
* **Agent A (Basic):** A factual, cold storyteller.
* **Agent B (Power):** "Nenek Lestari," a warm, culturally aware agent who uses sensory details and metaphors to provide emotional support.

### 🧰 What You’ll Need
* A **Google Cloud Project** with billing enabled.
* **Python 3.10+** installed.
* Access to **Vertex AI** and the `gemini-3-pro-preview` model.
