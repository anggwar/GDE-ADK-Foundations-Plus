# Build Agents with ADK: Foundations+  
### Workshop Project — "CeritaNenek" 👵🏻🪄  
*Learn the difference between regular and power-prompted agents using Google’s Agentic Development Kit (ADK).*

---

## 🧩 Overview
This workshop extends the official [Build Agents with ADK: Foundations](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/devsite/codelabs/build-agents-with-adk-foundation?hl=en) codelab with a fun, local twist — **CeritaNenek**, an Indonesian storytelling agent(s) (maybe?).

You’ll build **two versions of the same agent**:
1. A **basic version** using simple instructions (regular prompt)  
2. An **enhanced version** using **power prompting** for richer, more human-like storytelling

This side-by-side comparison helps beginners *see and feel* the power of structured prompting in action.

### What You’ll Learn
-How to define an agent using ADK Foundations
-How to give your agent memory, reasoning, and personality
-How to apply the Power Prompt Formula for better agent behavior
-How to deploy and test the agent in your local environment or Cloud Run

### Workshop Goals
-By the end of this codelab, you will:
